  Start.
  Exploring a possibility of developing a rescue boot loader for a TOWNS with a dead CD-ROM drive.
  The goal is to start the new boot loader from a floppy disk or a virtual SCSI hard drive, and then load a system on the external SCSI CD drive.
  So far succeeded in starting the IPL sector, and draw a test message on the screen.
